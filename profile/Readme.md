# BlueWave Labs

At BlueWave Labs, we bring together a diverse team of brilliant minds —software developers, UI/UX experts, mobile app developers, and visionary product managers—passionate about crafting cutting-edge solutions that redefine industries.

# Mission statement 

At BlueWave Labs, our mission is to support the creation of open-source software that helps businesses and people. We focus on B2B/SaaS projects using JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. By bringing together developers and organizations, we aim to build high-quality software that benefits everyone.

# Our vision 

We want to be a leading foundation for open-source B2B/SaaS software, where great ideas become real products that make a difference. Our goal is to create a community where developers and organizations work together to build software that is open, accessible, and helpful to people everywhere. BlueWave Labs is committed to ensuring that all our projects meet high standards of quality and ethics.

# What we are working on

There are 5 open source projects we are building.

* **BlueWave HRM**: A tool to automate routine administrative tasks such as payroll processing, benefits administration, time and attendance tracking and employee onboarding/offboarding.
* **BlueWave Onboarding**: An in-app tutorial platform that guides new users through an app or a tool’s user interface and key features. It features product tours, checklists, tutorials, or tooltips, which will help companies simplify their user onboarding process.
* **BlueWave Uptime**: An automated way of checking whether a service such as a website or an application is available. When service goes down during an outage (downtime), the application spots the issue and alerts the right person on the development team.
* **BlueWave DataRoom**: A secure space where confidential documents can be kept and only read by people authorized to access them. 
* **BlueWave ChatFabrica**: This AI-powered app learns your knowledgebase by scanning web pages and PDFs. You can then easily integrate it into your website and immediately use your customer support chatbot.
