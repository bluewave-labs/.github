# BlueWave Labs

At BlueWave Labs, we're not just a company; we're a dynamic force driving technological evolution. We bring together a diverse team of brilliant minds—software developers, UI/UX experts, mobile app developers, and visionary product managers—passionate about crafting cutting-edge solutions that redefine industries.

## What we are working on

There are 3 open source projects we are building.

* **BlueWave HRM**: A tool to automate routine administrative tasks such as payroll processing, benefits administration, time and attendance tracking and employee onboarding/offboarding.
* **BlueWave Onboarding**: An in-app tutorial platform that guides new users through an app or a tool’s user interface and key features. It features product tours, checklists, tutorials, or tooltips, which will help companies simplify their user onboarding process.
* **BlueWave Uptime**: An automated way of checking whether a service such as a website or an application is available. When service goes down during an outage (downtime), the application spots the issue and alerts the right person on the development team.
